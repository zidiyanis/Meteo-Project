In order to compile this project you have to enter the 
command "make" on the terminal and the executable is 
ready to use.

# ------ How to use the application ------ #

In order to know how you can use this application you can
type the command ./filter.sh --help
Here two exemples : 

./script_meteo.sh -p2 -w -A -f meteo_filtered_data_v1.csv
./script_meteo.sh -A -f meteo_filtered_data_v1.csv -p2 --avl -w 

Theses two commands make the same result, a graph with 
pression informations and another graph with wind 
informations in the Antilles

# ------ Differents types of graphs -------- #

To make the programm works you will need to specify somme arguments
You do not need to write them in a very specific order they just need to 
be put in the command after the ./skript.sh
Here is a list of the argument

  Geographic restriction :
    -F : for metropolitain France
    -G : for Guyane
    -S : for Saint-Pierre et Miquelon
    -A : for Antilles
    -O : for Indian Ocean
    -Q : for Antarctique
  If you have data coming from another country it should work
  unless the station IDE are not in the 71000 format.
  If you want all of your data or if you have data from another country, don't specify
  this argument
  Note that you can't many Geographic at once 
  (for example you can't ask for data in Antarctique and in Guyane simultaneously)
  
  Time restriction :
    -d <YYYY-DD-MM> <YYYY-DD-MM>
   Note that there is actually no "<>"
   The data will be restricted to only data between thoose two dates
   It will send an error if The first one is greater than the second one
   
   Sort mode :
    --avl : to sort in an avl
    --abr : to sort in an abr
    --tab : to sort in a tab
   This refere to the sort in the C programm
   
   Your data
    -f <fileName.csv> : to specify the data you want to use
   Note that it can be a .txt or basically everything you want
   Just make sure that you have the rights on tis file, because if not it may send an error
   The file in entry has to be in the same directory as the skript.sh
   
   Help 
     --help : to display the help message wich is basically a section of this makefile
   
   Type of data :
    -t : for temperatures
    -p : for pression
    -w : for wind
    -m : for moisture
    -h : for heigt
   For temperature and pression you will need to specify the mode, modes are :
    1 : min max and average per station
    2 : average per day
    3 : average per day per station
   So for example if you want the temperature in mode one, enter the argument -t1
